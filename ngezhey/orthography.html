		<p>
			There are two ways to write Ngezhey.
			Ngezhey has its own script,
			and there is a romanization.
			This document will discuss the romanization only
			because the Ngezhey script can not easily be displayed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ngezhey is written with one letter per phoneme.
			Native Ngezhey words are written with minuscule letters.
			Loan words are written with majiscule letters.
			Numbers are written the same in native and root words.
			In compound words, the component words are written
			with a dash ⟨-⟩ between them.
			If a compound word is composed of both native and root word,
			the native parts are written minuscule,
			and the loans are written majuscule.

	<h2 id="punctiation">Punctuation</h2>
		<p>
			Ngezhey has little punctuation.
			Sentences are separated from eachother
			with spaces (typically two or three in a row).
			There is also quotation in Ngezhey.
			The romanization uses parentheses to quote.
